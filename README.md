# Fort Carson Roleplay gamemode
I have created this script with a couple other SA:MP developers, such as Aviv, Jackmar, Fresh. Aviv put me in charge of letting people have access to this gamemode, so here is the official release. I don't take credits of the includes or the functions used. The credits to those goes to the respective authors and contributors.

Here's a list of all the features it contains:
* Completely self-building SQLite database
* Player accounts system
* Dynamic ban system with auto player unbanning after the specified days after the ban date
* Dynamic Doors system
* Basic administrator commands
* Basic roleplay commands
* Animation system
* Server-side money system
* Independant spawn system
* Anti-health/armour hack system
* Real world time sync
* Log out spot saving
* Reports handling system with a dynamic mute system which unmutes the player after the specified minutes

Enjoy the gamemode.
